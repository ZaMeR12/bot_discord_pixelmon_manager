## What is this discord bot?

This discord bot have for purpose to manager the league and the badges of informations of a user in a discord's server. Especially for server who use an RP minecraft Pixelmon server. **WARNING**: *The bot doesn't creates roles either administrate the server like moderator bot.*


## Important stuff:


### .env file:
You have to create and *.env* in the root of your derver to manager the bot. There is an example of it in the *[.envExample](./.envExample)*

```dotenv
## Connection to the bot account ##
CONNECTION_BOT = XXX

## Discord server id ##
SERVER_DISCORD = XXX

## Bot id ##
CLIENT_ID = XXX

## Connection to MongoDB ##
MONGO_SERVER = XXX
```

> To know all each variables mean you can watch the tutorial of *Under Ctrl*

### Server NodeJS:

the application is coded in NodeJS. So you have to implement all the files in a server who can run NodeJS.

#### Classic way to run the bot:
In the server terminal
```console
node ./src/index.js
```

Result expected:
```console
node ./src/index.js
DB connected
âœ… <Bot username> is online.
```
### Lists of pokemon's types and discord's role for gym leaders

These lists can be edited by the dev depending the need in the file *[Lists.js](./src/utils/Lists.js)* at the path ***src/utils/Lists.js***.

```js
module.exports = {
    // List of all persmissions roles for badges
    rolesPermission: [
        "Gym Leader - Water",
        "Gym Leader - Fire",
        "Gym Leader - Grass",
        "Gym Leader - Ice",
        "Gym Leader - Fairy",
        "Gym Leader - Psychic",
        "Gym Leader - Ghost",
        "Gym Leader - Poison",
        "Gym Leader - Steel",
        "Gym Leader - Dark",
        "Gym Leader - Ground",
        "Gym Leader - Normal",
        "Gym Leader - Flying",
        "Gym Leader - Bug",
        "Gym Leader - Electric",
        "Gym Leader - Fighting",
        "Gym Leader - Dragon",
        "Gym Leader - Rock"
    ],
    //List of all types of pokemons
    listTypes: [
        'water',
        'fire',
        'grass',
        'ice',
        'fairy',
        'psychic',
        'ghost',
        'poison',
        'steel',
        'dark',
        'ground',
        'normal',
        'flying',
        'bug',
        'electric',
        'fighting',
        'dragon',
        'rock'
    ]
};
```
> **IMPORTANT**: The order of each type of leader need to follow the same order of the list of pokemon's type and with the same number of items for each to not create logic error in the bot.


### Database choice:

I decide to choose MongoDB as database server.Why? Because the SQL format for this case of database can make it limited to the number of user. Than MongoDb use json base for the database, so it's just the size of the database that affect performance. (I want to mean by that in general)

So you have to take in consideration to use a cloudserver that use MongoDB. Sorry, people who wanted to manage all the database in the same place of bot.

An exemple of the model of the database can be found at the file *[model_DB.json](./src/database/model_DB.json)* at the path ***/src/database/model_DB.json***.

```json
{
	"_id":"650fc6b3d4d2efecc7082f47",
	"discord_id": "521369475812365948",
	"minecraft_username":"Test",
	"isChampion":false,
	"succeedLeague":false,
	"badges": [
		{
			"type": "fire",
			"obtained":"2023-09-20"
		}
	],
	"inscryption": "2023-09-24T07:58:52.580+00:00"
}
```

#### Explaination of the model:
